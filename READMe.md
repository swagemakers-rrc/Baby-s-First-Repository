## Assignment
Name: Assignment 1 (Module 1)
Description: A small test to demonstrate our understanding of setting up a Git repo, making changes, adding descriptions, and pushing commits to our corresponding GitHub repo.

## First git status output:
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   READMe.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Purpose of the following commands:

- 'mkdir': commands the terminal to create a new directory
- 'cd': commands the terminal to change directories to the one specified after 'cd'
- 'code': opens VSCode with whatever directory was specified after 'code' e.g.: 'code C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\File'
- 'ls': lists all files in the directory except for hidden files

## Why Version Control is important:

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. The systems are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. It is vital because developers need to be able to see what changes have been made in branches before they are pushed to the main branch, which helps them ensure the correct changes have been made and approved of before being commited to. It is also useful in case a mistake is pushed out, or the team runs into unexpected bugs and errors. Using version control allows them to wind back the clock, so to speak, and see which changes were made, and when. Doing this, they can work backward to see the newest changes and identify which one(s) are causing the issue. If there was no version control implementation, seeing these changes over time to source code would be impossible, and an mistakes would be permanent if the team is unable to identify the changes made. 

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- 'git init': create a new, empty Git repository (a .git  directory with subdirectories inside) or reinitialize an existing one.
- 'git status': displays which branch the user is currently on (master, main, etc.), whether or not the branch is up to date with the master branch and whether or not there is anything to commit (any unsaved changes that need committing).
- 'git add': updates the history of changes with whatever the latest changes are that the user made to the content. Multiple changes can be saved this way before the final version is actually committed. 
- 'git commit': Records the changes the user made to the content, and saves the latest version of the content to the repository.
- 'git push': Updates the remote repository with the latest version of the content in the local repository.
- 'git pull': This command was not used in the project. It pulls the most recent version of a remote repository to the user's local repository.
- 'git log': This command was not used in the project. It shows the commit logs; a list of commits made going back to the original content.
- 'git branch': Allows the user to list, create, or delete branches.
- 'git merge': Join two or more divergent branches together again e.g. reintegrate a branch with the main/master branch after adding and committing new changes to the differing branch. 
- 'git checkout': Switch branches or restore files

## My Unique Touch

### Describe something that sets me apart from others

This is difficult because I generally view myself as very 'average' or ordinary in many ways. I suppose I'm most defined by my artistic ability, as I do love creating art; it is a longterm passion of mine. I also love video games, especially the mmorpg game Final Fantasy XIV. I've made a lot of great friends playing that game, and we hangout on discord voice chat a lot, sometimes even just to watch TV or movies together. Other than those things, I suppsoe I am taller than the average Canadian woman by several inches, and I have terrible eyesight, so I need to wear glasses. Hopefully one day I can just get LASIK, because glasses really do suck.
