## Assignment
Name: Assignment 1 (Module 1)
Description: A small test to demonstrate our understanding of setting up a Git repo, making changes, adding descriptions, and pushing commits to our corresponding GitHub repo.

## First git status output:
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   READMe.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
